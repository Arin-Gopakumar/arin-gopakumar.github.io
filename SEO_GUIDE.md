### 2. Create Backlinks to Your Site

Add your website URL to these places (the more places link to you, the higher you rank):

**High Priority:**
- ✅ **LinkedIn** - Add `https://aringopakumar.github.io` to your profile (Contact Info section)
- ✅ **Twitter/X Bio** - Add your website link
- ✅ **GitHub Profile** - Add to your bio and pin the repository
- ✅ **ICML Author Profile** - Add your website if possible
- ✅ **UC Berkeley Directory** - If available for students
- ✅ **Research Lab Websites** - Ask to be listed with your website on:
  - Algoverse AI
  - Duke Hong Lab
  - Any other labs you've worked with

**Medium Priority:**
- Academic profiles: Google Scholar, ResearchGate, ORCID
- Social media: Instagram bio, other platforms
- Any university club/organization pages you're part of

### 3. Link Your Profiles Together

Make sure all your online profiles link to each other:
- LinkedIn → Your website
- Your website → LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter
- GitHub → Your website
- Twitter → Your website

This creates a "network effect" that helps Google connect all your content to your name.

## Medium-Term Actions (Within 1-2 Weeks)

### 4. Get Mentioned on Other Sites
- Ask your research labs to add you to their team pages with a link to your site
- If you write any blog posts or articles, link back to your site
- Contribute to open source projects (your GitHub profile links to your site)

### 5. Add Structured Data (JSON-LD)
This helps Google create a "knowledge panel" for you. I can add this if you want - it tells Google you're a person, not just a website.

### 6. Share Your Website
- Post on LinkedIn: "Excited to launch my personal website!"
- Share on Twitter
- Email signature: Add your website
- Resume/CV: Add your website URL
